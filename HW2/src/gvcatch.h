//  gvcatch.h

/*
 catch.hpp is a HUGE file (47600+ lines after all the internal #includes are resolved)!
 In order to gain the benefit by precompiled headers by some newer compilers
 we keep two following two lines of preprocessor directives inside a separate file.
 When your compiler supports precompile headers, you may see a file gvcatch.pch
 in your project.
